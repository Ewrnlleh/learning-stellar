 How this contract should be used:
 1. Call `create` once to create the offer and register its seller.
 2. Seller may transfer arbitrary amounts of the `sell_token` for sale to the
    contract address for trading. They may also update the offer price.
 3. Buyers may call `trade` to trade with the offer. The contract will
   immediately perform the trade and send the respective amounts
   of `buy_token` and `sell_token` to the seller and buyer respectively.
 4. Seller may call `withdraw` to claim any remaining `sell_token` balance.
